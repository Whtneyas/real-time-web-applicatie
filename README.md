## Proof of concept 

 Proof of concept is a test that is done to see if an idea, technology or product can work the way it is intended. It involves creating a prototype or model that is tested to determine if it meets the desired objectives before investing further resources into its development.
I have three concepts in mind, and I will choose one out of the three to work with further.

## Concept 1 - Guess the lyrics
My first concept is tO guess the lyrics concept. i think this idea or design already exist. With this guess de lyrics game. Multiple users have to play to make it more fun. The user first log in with his or her name and waits still other players join to start. The user can also play it individual if there is no one joing the game. 

###  Features 
- A logging in with user name 
- Users can see when other users are online;
- Users  can see other user when typing 
- Users can see when a user is typing. 
- User can also see the time of the chat
- Scores will be displayed . 


## Concept 2 - Quiz Geography 

The second concept is a geographical quiz game whereby the user guesses the answer by choosing from multiple answers. First of all the user would have to log in with his or her username to join the quiz.After finishing the quiz the user will see his or her scores on a board 



## Concept 3 - Scribbl game 
My last concept was to create a scribbr game where user can guess a word by drawings of others and also create their own scribble game.



## Chosen Concept - Quiz app 

My final choice will be the Quiz app, where users can select a topic to be quizzed on. Additionally, there will be a chat system where users can join chatrooms on various topics such as history, games, music, etc. As previously mentioned, users will first need to log in with a username of their choice. Once logged in, they will be directed to the topic and chatroom page, where they can choose to join a chatroom on a specific topic or participate in a quiz of their choice."

## API - Trivia api 
Link: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

In order to implement various quiz topics within my project, I plan on utilizing Trivia API, a website that allows you to generate an api based on a quiz topic . Because there wasn't much time on my side so i had to choose one topic to work on. SO i chose the general knowledge quiz. 

### Fetching trivia Api 

The  code below  fetches trivia general knowledge  questions from an API using the axios library. It then processes the response to extract the questions, correct answers, and choices. The first question is sent to a connected client through a socket connection. The current question index and all the questions are stored in the socket object. If there is an error, it logs an error message.

## Designs in figma 
To get a view of how the application will look. I made designs in figma so that when i start coding i won't have t think of the color i will be using or how it should look like. So i thought of making my designs reading before i start coding.
