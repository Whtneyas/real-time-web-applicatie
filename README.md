## Proof of concept 

 Proof of concept is a test that is done to see if an idea, technology or product can work the way it is intended. It involves creating a prototype or model that is tested to determine if it meets the desired objectives before investing further resources into its development.
I have three concepts in mind, and I will choose one out of the three to work with further.

## Concept 1 - Guess the lyrics
My first concept is tO guess the lyrics concept. i think this idea or design already exist. With this guess de lyrics game. Multiple users have to play to make it more fun. The user first log in with his or her name and waits still other players join to start. The user can also play it individual if there is no one joing the game. 

###  Features 
- A logging in with user name 
- Users can see when other users are online;
- Users  can see other user when typing 
- Users can see when a user is typing. 
- User can also see the time of the chat
- Scores will be displayed . 


## Concept 2 - Quiz Geography 

The second concept is a geographical quiz game whereby the user guesses the answer by choosing from multiple answers. First of all the user would have to log in with his or her username to join the quiz.After finishing the quiz the user will see his or her scores on a board 



## Concept 3 - Scribbl game 
My last concept was to create a scribbr game where user can guess a word by drawings of others and also create their own scribble game.



## Chosen Concept - Quiz geography 

My final choice will go for the Quiz geography. As i already made mention. I would like the user to first begin by logging in with a username of choice and then joining to start the quiz. The users can also interact with eachother by sending direct messages.
